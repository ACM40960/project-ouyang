# Hello!
This is a repository for my project!

## Description
This is my project repository, a project about studying the contribution of human industrial activities in global warming, I collected and processed a lot of data sets and analyzed them. And I put all the python code I used here, and some important figures and figures I used in the poster will also be in the ipynb file.  
And because the entire data processing process is constantly repeated and modified, one stage at a time, there is no one-click function to complete the entire analysis. Below I will list the purpose of each of my files.
